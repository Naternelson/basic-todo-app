# React Todo Application Tutorial

Welcome to the React Todo Application tutorial! This guide will walk you through creating a basic todo application using React and TypeScript. If you're new to React or TypeScript, don't worry! This tutorial is designed to help beginners get a solid understanding of how to build React applications with type safety.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (preferably the latest LTS version)
- A code editor (Visual Studio Code, Atom, etc.)
- Git for cloning the repository

## Getting Started

To begin, you will need to fork and clone the repository provided for this tutorial. Make sure you are on the `student` branch before you start making changes. This branch is specifically set up for you to work on.
```
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL> -b student
cd <REPOSITORY_FOLDER>
```
Replace <REPOSITORY_URL> and <REPOSITORY_FOLDER> with the actual URL of the repository and the folder name respectively.

Installation
Once you have cloned the repository, navigate into the project directory and install the necessary libraries with the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install
This command will read the package.json file and install all the dependencies required for the project.

Components
In this tutorial, you will work on three main components:

src/components/Container: This component serves as the main wrapper for your todo application. It will hold the state of your todos and render the InputField and TodoList components.

src/components/InputField: This component is responsible for rendering an input field. Users can type their todo item here and add it to the list.

src/components/TodoList: This component displays the list of todos. It will receive todos as props from the Container component and render them accordingly.

TypeScript
This application is written in TypeScript to provide type safety. TypeScript helps catch errors early through its type system. Here are some basics you'll encounter:

Interface: Defines the shape of objects or components props.
Type: Similar to interfaces, but can be used with primitives and unions.
You'll see TypeScript in action as you work on the components.

Running the Application
To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This command will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. You can now view and test your todo application as you develop it.

Completing the Tutorial
Work on the components as described in the sections above. If you encounter any issues, refer back to this guide or consult the React and TypeScript documentation for more detailed explanations.

Viewing the Completed Application
If you want to see the completed version of the application for reference, you can switch to the main branch of the repository:

bash
Copy code
git checkout main
This branch contains the final, completed version of the todo application. Feel free to explore the code and compare it with your work on the student branch.

Happy coding!
